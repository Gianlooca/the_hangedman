## Manual Testing
I constantly tested manually the general performance of the program, both on the my workspace and on the deployed website (that you can find [here](https://the-hangedman-9d230e2d51fc.herokuapp.com/)), thrthroughout its development. The flow of the game is working, so does its logic; therefore we're going to test (and show the results of those tests) what it's considered to be the weakest part of such a game, that are the inputs.
